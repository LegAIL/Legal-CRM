## SQL Operations Summary
All operations were performed using Prisma ORM within a single transaction to ensure atomicity:

```javascript
// Key operations performed:
- DELETE FROM activities WHERE userId NOT IN (keepUserIds)
- DELETE FROM time_entries WHERE userId NOT IN (keepUserIds)  
- DELETE FROM comments WHERE authorId NOT IN (keepUserIds)
- UPDATE milestones SET completedById = NULL WHERE completedById NOT IN (keepUserIds)
- UPDATE cases SET createdById = NULL WHERE createdById NOT IN (keepUserIds)
- DELETE FROM users WHERE id NOT IN (keepUserIds)
- UPDATE users SET role = 'ASSOCIATE' WHERE email = 'Tom@laware.se'
- UPDATE users SET role = 'LAWYER' WHERE email = 'thinh@laware.se'  
- UPDATE users SET role = 'ASSOCIATE' WHERE email = 'Momo@laware.se'
```

## Recommendations
1. **Backup Retention:** Keep the database backup for at least 30 days
2. **User Testing:** Verify login functionality for all three users in the application UI
